### What is CloudGoBrrr?
It is a super simple and easy to use open source self-hosted cloud as an alternative to the big cloud providers. This way you manage your own data and no one else.

### How can I help?
Just check the issues for either the backend or the frontend and try implementing a feature request or try fixing a bug. We always love new contributions and pull requests that help us save some time on development. ;)

[^1]: Nooo you can't just write your own cloud. Haha fast cloud goes brrrrrr
